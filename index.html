    <h1>Towards Explainable and Interpretable Musical Difficulty Estimation</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the companion website for our paper submitted for review at the 25th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference, 2024, in San Francisco, USA. This site is dedicated to extending our work on a parameter-efficient approach to musical difficulty estimation, allowing for deeper exploration and interaction.</p>
    <p>The website is currently under construction. Soon, you will be able to access an interactive tool designed to explore the nuances of musical difficulty estimation as discussed in our research. Stay tuned for updates and additional resources.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your interest in our work!</p>
